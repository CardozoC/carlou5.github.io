##Learning Markdown
######*Writing for Interactive Design* - Week 1

In my **Writing for Interactive Design** class, we begun by creating a Github account and setting it up with the static site generator, Jekyll, to create a blog where we will be learning how to write blog posts and other content for websites. Markdown is a ironically a markup language that is used to simplify things you use to edit your Jekyll-Powered site. 

For example:

If you'd like to write bold text in regular HTML you would usually write the following:  
&lt;strong&gt;text&lt;/strong&gt;  
The previous code will output: <strong>text</strong>

In Markdown, the bold text would be as simple as writing the following:  
&#42;&#42;text&#42;&#42;  
The previous code will output: **text**

As you can see this is a valuable time-saver and it is also less complicated for users with no html knowledge.
