Often, we Web Designers hear that our sites should be mobile-friendly or responsive... It can be hard to choose how to make a responsive site with so many options available to achieve this. 

The next best thing is always changing, so it is a bit intimidating to dive into a new programming language or framework. There is one CSS Framework that can help you with this mess: Bootstrap. By linking Bootstrap to your site, you can simply add classes to your tags in order to style them. The combination of some classes and your div tags will make your reponsive layouts a breeze to create. So to help you expand into responsive layouts, I'll show you a few tricks to incorporate Bootstrap easily into your site.

##Bootstrap 101

###1. Link the bootstrap file to your website

There are two ways to link the boostrap css file to your site. 

You can download the boostrap css file and host it on your server
<code><link href="/yourfolder/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"></code>

Or, you can link directly to a CDN(content delivery network). This is the better option because it faster and will likely be cached in your browser from another site that also used it.
<code><link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"></code>
