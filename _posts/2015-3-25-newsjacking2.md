Jeremy Clarkson one of the original hosts of the long-running tv show Top Gear has been fired for physically assaulting a producer. BBC is in talks to replace him with another host.

The moral of this story is that no matter how great something is, problematic things have to be removed and replaced with better performing ones. This concept also applies to web and programming in general. You can't stick with the same technologies, you have to learn and grow with the times. If you don't adapt, you won't be relevant in 5-10 years.

New technologies are always emerging and they replace old problematic ones. Flash animation, for example, was really big in the past. Due to problems that it cause with new technologies, it is now a thing of the past. Flash did not run on apple devices and it also negatively affected site's SEO ranking. Advances in HTML5 and CSS3 led developers to shift their skills in their direction. Flash was essentially "fired" from the web industry because it just didn't do its job correctly anymore.

In this industry you must be able to adapt to new technologies because they are always evolving. The current web technology that should be on everyone's to-learn list is responsive layouts. It involves a combination of several programming languages such as HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. With the wide use of mobile devices, it is critical to learn how to create responsive websites.

A good way to see what you need to learn for your line of work, is to search for jobs in your industry and see what employers are looking for. 

So go out there, do some research, learn, and keep up! Don't be left behind :)
