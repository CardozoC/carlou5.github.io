title: This soap will clean your dishes while saving the environment.
---

This wonderful dishwashing detergent leaves your dishes sparkling without the use of harsh chemicals or artificial dyes. This liquid soap is safe to use for washing baby bottles, fruits and vegetables because of its non-toxic formula. Don't be fooled by the lack of bubbles, this soap is still strong. The only reason that it's not as bubbly is that it lacks the phosphates found in other dish detergents, which damages the ecosystem. No animal by-products are used and it is also biodegradable.

Aunt Helen's Lemon Burst dish soap has a clean but neutral lemon smell that cleans food residue and serves as a powerful degreaser, while also being gentle on allergies and your hands. This product is one of many offered by the wonderful people at Casa Natura.
