Casa Natura's wonderful dishwashing detergent leaves your dishes sparkling without the use of harsh chemicals or artificial dyes. This liquid soap is safe to use for washing baby bottles, fruits, and vegetables due to their its non-toxic formula. Do not be fooled by the lack of bubbles, this soap still cuts through grease and grime. The only reason that it is not as bubbly is that it lacks the phosphates found in other dish detergents, which damages the ecosystem. No animal by-products are used to make their products and they are also biodegradable. In our testing, this soap cut through the grease with ease and exceeded our expectations. The wonderful lemon scent made cleaning dishes an enjoyable task.
